			<h2>Overview</h2>
			Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

			<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
			<p>
				In this task I implemented a simple rasterizer that works by checking if the center of a pixel is within the bounds of the three points given to define a triangles' vertices.
				The result is that the rasterizer can draw and color in any triangle given three points. Prior to implementing this function, I didn't understand why we needed a consistent winding
				order for the triangle vertices. As I drew out examples to check my understanding, I figured out that it needed to be consistent to ensure the half planes that make up the triangle
				intersect properly.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this task, I start by checking the winding order of the triangle's points by calculating the cross product of the edges P0P1 and P1P2 to get the z-component.
				If this z value is less than zero, it shows that the winding order is clockwise. As needed, I switch the second and third given triangle vertices to make the winding order counterclockwise.
				Afterwards, I calculate the bounding box of the triangle by looking for the floors and ceilings of the lowest and highest x- and y-values out of the triangle vertices. Then, I use two for loops
				to iterate through every pixel in the bounding box and check whether the center of that pixel is inside the triangle. I wrote a helper function to calculate whether the point I'm checking
				is on the right side of the line with the line test equation provided during Lecture 2. If the center of the pixel passes this test for all three edges of the triangle, I fill the pixel in with the given color.
			</p>
			<p>
				My algorithm only checks the pixels that are within the bounding box so there isn't any work being wasted checking points where the triangle couldn't possibly be. I calculate this box by getting the
				minimum and maximum x- and y-values from the given vertices. Then I call floor() on the minimum values and ceiling() on the maximum values to ensure floats will be included when we get nearest
				integers that define the pixel boudnaries.
			</p>

			<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
			<p>
				For this task, I built up my algorithm from Task 1 to support pixel supersampling at sample rates 1, 4, 9, and 16. Supersampling is useful to help smooth out the edges of images
				that don't fit neatly into one pixel or don't cross the center of the pixel where we sample. When parts of a triangle fall between pixels, we risk losing parts of the image, but
				supersampling allows us to get intermediary values at those points instead of losing them entirely. It also allows for smoother transitions between different colors instead of
				sharp jaggies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within my existing for loops, I added an additional two for loops to iterate over the subpixels within the main pixel. I use the same line test helper function I wrote for Task 1 to
				check if the subpixel lies within the triangle, but this time I apply the color to my sample buffer, instead of the actual framebuffer directly, if it passes the three-line test. I resized
				the sample buffer to have enough space to store the color values of every subpixel.
				After iterating through every subpixel, I calculate the average color of each real pixel out of its corresponding subpixels in resolve_to_framebuffer() to draw on the real framebuffer
				since there are more values in the sample buffer than in the framebuffer.
				Where a pixel's supersampled points don't cover the entire pixel, the pixel is lighter and it antialiases the sharp, uneven edges on my triangles where there are high frequencies.
			</p>
			<p>
				The images below show the differences in a high frequency part of the image at different sampling rates. In the original image without supersampling, there are gaps between points where the
				rasterizer misses the triangle because it only samples the center of each pixel. As the supersampling rate increases, we see more of the triangle because the subpixels that we sample help preserve
				more information about where the triangle is than if we only sample the pixel's center. At supersampling rate 16, there are no longer missing pixels at the corner of the red triangle and we
				can see more intermediary values than at rate 4 because there are more samples to average the color out of. These intermediary colors also make the edges look softer than if we only had two values
				for the color or plain white.

			<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
			<p>
				After implementing the affine transform matrices that we saw in class, I tried to make my robot man do a dance. At first, the rotation matrix wasn't working properly which I later figured out was because
				the built-in sine and cosine functions normally take in radians, but we wanted it to work by passing in degrees. After adding a degree to radian conversion, I then encountered the problem of my matrix
				rotating the images clockwise instead of counterclockwise. I fixed this by flipping the signs for the sine values in the matrix and it finally started working as expected.
				I tested out different orders of the transforms and found that the following order made moving each piece match what I expected: translate, rotate, then scale.
				The rectangles would get warped if I put rotation anywhere else in the order.
			</p>
			<p>
				My final robot man is doing a dance with his arms bent outwards while he's hopping to one side. I tilted his head and tried to make his leg bends less symmetrical to make him look like
				he's mid-jump. He's also a golden yellow because that's my favorite color.

			<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
			<p>
				Barycentric coordinates are a way to describe a point within a triangle as its distance from each of the triangle's vertices. The vertices are assigned associated with a weight of either alpha, beta, or gamma, all of
				which sum up to 1 and are greater or equal to zero. If the weights sum to 1 but any of them are less than zero, the point lies on the same plane as the triangle but not inside the triangle itself. We can think of each
				weight like the strength at which each vertex is pulling the point towards it. The vertices can also represent other values such as colors and the point within the triangle would be the color made up of a combination
				of each vertex color at the proportions of the weights.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this task, I reused most of my supersampling algorithm from Task 2. I maintained the parts that ensure a consistent winding order and iterate over the triangle's bounding box to sample. The main difference is that
				when I check a sample point within the triangle, I calculate the alpha, beta, and gamma weights for vertices A, B, and C respectively. Then, I'd assign the sampled point in the sample buffer as the color at the sum of each
				weight and their respective colors.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the extra triangles I made below, we can see how colors being assigned to each vertex of a triangle can result in a gradient between the colors inside. Each point in the triangle gets sampled to be a combination
				of the colors I assigned to the vertices. The color wheel image is a combination of multiple different color-blended triangles being put together to create a seamless gradient.

			<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
			<p>
				In this task, I implemented pixel sampling for textures. This process involves mapping a triangle, or on a larger scale, multiple triangles that make up a larger picture, to a texture. I reuse the parts of my earlier
				supersampling algorithm to iterate over the pixels (or subpixels) of a triangle's bounding box and ensure a consistent vertex winding order. Then, I calculate the alpha, beta, and gamma weights of the sample point relative
				to the triangle's vertices. I get the (u, v) coordinates after using the weights to interpolate the points given from the texture map. As I move on to sample the texture pixel (texel) at (u,v), I get the option of using either
				nearest neighbor sampling or bilinear interpolation. Nearest neighbor sampling refers to taking the texel at the closest point to (u,v) multiplied by the width and height of the texture to make sure they're scaled correctly.
				Bilinear interpolation involves sampling from the nearest four pixels around (u,v) and interpolating both vertically and horizontally to get an average color value of the texels.
			</p>

					<td style="text-align: center;">

				</tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="images/task5-nn-rate16.png" width="350px" />
                        <figcaption>Nearest sampling, 16 samples per pixel</figcaption>
                    </td>
                    <td style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="images/task5-bl-rate16.png" width="350px" />
                        <figcaption>Bilinear sampling, 16 samples per pixel</figcaption>
                    </td>
                </tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				We can see in the images above that the grid of the map gets chopped up with nearest sampling whereas with bilinear sampling, the lines are still broken but they're more smoothed out. Nearest sampling leads to sharper edges
				in areas that change color and can't show as smooth of a transition as bilinear sampling that takes into account multiple pixels' information. 
				At the higher sampling rate of 16, I don't see as much of a difference between the images. I feel like bilinear sampling has more of an advantage over nearest sampling only at lower sampling rates and image resolutions. Because it takes the computer more
				work to do bilinear interpolation, I think it loses if the sampling rate is higher because it results in almost the same quality of image as nearest sampling despite nearest sampling requiring less computing. When nearest sampling has access
				to lots of information, the quality of the texture mapping will also be good.
